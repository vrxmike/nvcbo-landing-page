# GitHub Actions Workflow Optimization - NVCBO Landing Page

## Issue Overview

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Problem:** Redundant GitHub Actions workflow files causing duplicate deployments  
**Impact:** Wasted GitHub Actions minutes and potential deployment conflicts  

## Problem Description

The project contained two GitHub Actions workflow files that both triggered on pushes to the `master` branch:

1. `.github/workflows/static.yml` - Simple deployment workflow
2. `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` - Advanced workflow with Git LFS support

This caused both workflows to run simultaneously on every push, resulting in:
- Duplicate deployment jobs
- Unnecessary resource consumption
- Potential deployment race conditions
- Workflow management complexity

## Analysis of Workflow Files

### Comparison Table

| Feature | `static.yml` (Removed) | `deploy-pages.yml` (Kept) |
|---------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| **Jobs Structure** | Single `deploy` job | Separate `build` + `deploy` jobs |
| **Git LFS Support** | ❌ No LFS handling | ✅ Explicit LFS support |
| **Checkout Configuration** | Basic checkout | `lfs: true` with fetch/checkout |
| **Concurrency Control** | `cancel-in-progress: false` | `cancel-in-progress: true` |
| **Error Handling** | Basic | Better separation of concerns |
| **Debugging** | Limited | Enhanced with build/deploy phases |

### Why `deploy-pages.yml` Was Chosen

1. **Git LFS Compatibility**: The project uses Git LFS for font files, and `deploy-pages.yml` explicitly handles this:
   ```yaml
   - name: Checkout repository (with LFS)
     uses: actions/checkout@v4
     with:
       lfs: true
   
   - name: Ensure LFS files are present
     run: |
       git lfs fetch --all
       git lfs checkout
   ```

2. **Robust Architecture**: Separate build and deploy jobs provide:
   - Better error isolation
   - Clearer workflow stages
   - Enhanced debugging capabilities

3. **Proper Concurrency Control**: `cancel-in-progress: true` prevents conflicts when multiple pushes occur rapidly

## Solution Implementation

### Step 1: Analysis
```bash
# Examine both workflow files
cat .github/workflows/static.yml
cat .github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml
```

### Step 2: Remove Redundant Workflow
```bash
# Remove the less capable workflow
rm .github/workflows/static.yml
```

### Step 3: Commit Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Remove redundant static.yml workflow - keep deploy-pages.yml for better Git LFS support"
```

## Results

### Before Fix
- ✅ Deployment working (but inefficient)
- ❌ Two workflows running on every push
- ❌ Wasted GitHub Actions minutes
- ❌ Potential for deployment conflicts

### After Fix
- ✅ Single, optimized deployment workflow
- ✅ Better Git LFS support ensures font files deploy correctly
- ✅ Reduced GitHub Actions usage
- ✅ Eliminated potential deployment conflicts
- ✅ Cleaner workflow management

## Technical Details

### Retained Workflow Configuration

**File:** `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`

**Key Features:**
- **Triggers:** Push to master branch + manual dispatch
- **Permissions:** Minimal required permissions for Pages deployment
- **Build Job:** Handles Git LFS files and artifact preparation
- **Deploy Job:** Dedicated deployment to GitHub Pages
- **Concurrency:** Prevents overlapping deployments

**Critical LFS Handling:**
```yaml
steps:
  - name: Checkout repository (with LFS)
    uses: actions/checkout@v4
    with:
      lfs: true

  - name: Ensure LFS files are present
    run: |
      git lfs fetch --all
      git lfs checkout
```

This ensures that the font files tracked in Git LFS are properly available during deployment.

## Impact Assessment

### GitHub Actions Usage
- **Before:** ~2x Actions minutes per deployment
- **After:** Standard Actions minutes per deployment
- **Savings:** ~50% reduction in Actions usage

### Deployment Reliability
- **Before:** Risk of race conditions between workflows
- **After:** Single, controlled deployment process
- **Improvement:** Eliminated deployment conflicts

### Maintenance
- **Before:** Two workflow files to maintain
- **After:** Single workflow file to maintain
- **Improvement:** Simplified workflow management

## Best Practices Established

1. **Single Responsibility**: One workflow per deployment target
2. **LFS Compatibility**: Always configure LFS support for repositories using it
3. **Concurrency Control**: Use appropriate cancellation policies
4. **Documentation**: Document workflow decisions for future reference

## Verification

### Workflow Status Check
```bash
# Verify only one workflow exists
ls .github/workflows/
# Should show only: deploy-pages.yml

# Check workflow runs in GitHub Actions tab
# Should show single workflow per push after fix
```

### Deployment Testing
1. Push changes to master branch
2. Verify only one workflow runs
3. Confirm successful deployment to https://vrxmike.github.io/nvcbo-landing-page/
4. Validate all assets (fonts, images) load correctly

## Future Considerations

1. **Workflow Monitoring**: Regularly review Actions usage in repository insights
2. **LFS Management**: Monitor LFS bandwidth usage and file sizes
3. **Workflow Updates**: Keep actions/checkout and related actions updated
4. **Performance**: Consider build caching if workflow becomes more complex
